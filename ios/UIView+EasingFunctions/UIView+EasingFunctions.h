 Allows to assign custom [easing functions](http://easings.net/) to the animatable `UIView` properties.
 
 When a property, to which an easing function is assigned, is animated using [the block-based methods](http://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#documentation/windowsviews/conceptual/viewpg_iphoneos/animatingviews/animatingviews.html), the pacing of the animation is affected (or rather,  defined) by the assigned function.
